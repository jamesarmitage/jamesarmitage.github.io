After reading about Octopress, Jekyll and other static blogs, I wanted to give it a whirl myself.

Since I can start off with free at GitHub, the barrier to entry is pretty low.  It's just a matter of adding a few DNS records to my already-existing domain and following the base READMEs.

Longer term, I might want to bump this over to a Digital Ocean droplet, but for now this ought to suffice.
