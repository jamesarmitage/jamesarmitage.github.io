After reading about Octopress, Jekyll and other static blog engines, I wanted to give it a whirl myself.  Although the initial setup is a little more complicated than WordPress, the finished product seems perfect for my needs: a fast template-based blog I can serve from a variety of sources.

Since I can begin by [hosting it for free in a GitHub repository](https://github.com/jamesarmitage/jamesarmitage.github.io), the barrier to entry is pretty low.  It's just a matter of adding a few DNS records to my already-existing domain and following the base READMEs.

Longer term, I might want to bump this over to a Digital Ocean droplet, but for now this ought to suffice.
